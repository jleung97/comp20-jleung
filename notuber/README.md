TODO:
* Handle geo_error
* Send POST request with user's info
* Parse result
* Display other passengers / vehicles
* Ensure it works both ways
* Infowindows for everyone
* Calculate distances


I consulted the following sources:

[Error-handling for getting user's location](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp)

[Sending a POST request using XMLHTTPRequest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9713058/send-post-data-using-xmlhttprequest)
