# Jennifer Leung, COMP20

1. The purpose of this Git repository is to track my work in this course throughout the semester. Assignments and labs are submitted through this repository for grading. Using Git revision control allows me to save my changes or roll them back if the need arises.

2. Assignment 2, the front-end for notuber, was my favorite because I enjoyed the visuals of the work I was doing. It was also a first experience using an API to send and retrieve data. The usage of the Google Maps API to display data as points on a map was a great way for me to understand how the code I was writing translated into what I was seeing.

3. Taking COMP20 was definitely a good decision -- I've grown a lot in this semester in terms of learning. I came in with basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, but the class pushed me to explore more in terms of server-side technologies with Node and MongoDB, allowing me to go from just static web apps to ones with dynamic data.

4. My biggest takeaway would be the importance of security, especially in today's world. It is very easy to write code that "works," in that it gives you the output you desire, but that can also be easily broken and exploited. This emphasis on security throughout the course really instilled an appreciation for cybersecurity in me. One example is the OWASP Top 10 list, and the statistics associated with it in how many web applications are still vulnerable year after year. Another example was the Google XSS game, which was a fun way to learn about the malicious power of unsanitized input.

5. I think I would be most interested in looking more into server-side development, in terms of building more complicated applications using databases or frameworks aside from the ones we've learned in class. I'd like to be able to compare and contrast the different options to decide which I like best.
