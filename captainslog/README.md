1. Everyhthing has been implemented.
2. I did not collaborate with anyone, but referred to the following links:
    * [Ming's local_storage example](https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/cookies_localstorage/localstorage_example.html)
    * [Documentation on the Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
    * [Detecting an 'enter' keypress](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/979662/how-to-detect-pressing-enter-on-keyboard-using-jquery)
3. I spent approximately 1.5 hours on this.
